An improved tags experience based on the concept of projects.

**Warning**


This is an abandoned project. I personally no longer have any use for tags, and I no longer wish to maintaint this project. Insted of tags, I recommend using a language server or something like that which understands your code more deeply and uses the context of where you are performing an action to improve the accuracy of the result. For me tags continued to have too many false positives for my purposes even after refining this plugin, and my final conclusion is that tags themselves are a poor fit for what I was trying to use them for (mostly code definition lookup).

When I say I no longer whish to maintain this plugin, what I mean is, this plugin relies on my vim-eliv library, and I no longer wish to update the master branch of this plugin to be compatible with the latest code in the master branch of vim-elhiv. Theoretically, you should be able to compare the date of the last tagged release of this plugin, and use a commit from the vim-elhiv master branch just before or after that. If someone requests my help in an issue, I will update these instructions to be more helpful.


**Context**

This will search for your project root and save separate tag files per programming language for your source code. This plugin creates tag files automatically when you save code files. If you save a .js file, it only creates tags for other .js files in the project, and saves them in their own jstags file. If you save a .php file, it generates tags in a separate phptags file. When you are editing a file, and try to do a code lookup using tags, it will only search one tags file matching the language of the file you are editing, based on file extension. The point of all this is to avoid false positives and keep the tag matches to a minimum.

**Purpose**

This allows code lookup and code completion that uses tags to behave more intelligently, closer to how these features would work in a smart IDE.

`CTRL-]` In Vim, this normally jumps to the definition of the keyword under the cursor relying on tags generated by ctags. This plugin helps you tune and generate your tags so this jump to feature will work better.

In Vim and Noevim there are features and plugins that provide word/code completion. It is possible to configure your completion to draw from tags. This plugin helps you tune and generate your tags so code completion will work better. You should consult the documention of your favorite completion plugin or feature to set it up to draw from tags.

**Languages**

Out of the box, this only automatically generates tags for JavaScript, PHP, and VimL/Vimscript. But you can easily use this plugin with other ctags compatible languages just by specifying file extensions you want to work with. Just call the `project_tags#add_language()` function in your config and pass it a string with the file extension of the language you want to create tags for. Alternatively, you can also pass in a list of file extentions to add support for multiple languages at once. This only works for languages that rely on a single file extension. In other words, it won't work with c because it is split between .c and .h files. Here is an example that adds support for python:

`call project_tags#add_language('py')`

Here is an example that adds support for both python and Lua:

`call project_tags#add_language(['py', 'lua'])`

You don't need to worry about whether you are adding support for an already supported language. If you call that function with a duplicate file extension, it will just be ignored. This means that if you prefer, you can just call that function for each file extension you want to create tags for without worrying about whether or not the plugin already has built in support for that language.

You can also provide a custom executable name or full path to to your ctags, but you don't need to. Example:

`let g:project_tags_ctags_path= 'myctags'`

**Installation**

Install it the normal way you install Vim plugins. This also depends on the [vim-elhiv](https://github.com/still-dreaming-1/vim-elhiv/tree/master) plugin, so you will have to install that as well. You need to create a file named ".project_tags.config.vim" and place it in the project root directory of code projects you wish to use this plugin with.

**Versions**

Use the latest commit on the master branch, that is the most stable commit. Do not use the latest tag as there may be new commits on master that keep it compatible with the master branch of the elhiv dependency. I only merge the develop branch into master after doing a release or making changes to keep the master branch compatible with the master branch of the elhiv dependency. The master branch works correctly with the latest master branch commit in the vim-elhiv library plugin. Unless you want to contribute code or help me debug, I don't recommend using the develop branch. If you do use the develop branch, realize it is designed to be used with the develop branch of the vim-elhiv library plugin. I haven't yet figured out a good way to tie specific tagged version releases to a specific tagged version of vim-elhiv. If you want to use an older tagged version you will have to compare the commit date and time to that of the commits to vim-elhiv and try it with the vim-elhiv commit just before the vim-project-tags tag/release. If that doesn't work sometimes I find a bug in vim-elhiv and quickly fix it so it may work better with the following vim-elhiv commit. I use automated tests to keep the latest version / master commit stable, so I really recommend just using that.

**Configuration**

You need to create a file named ".project_tags.config.vim" and place it in the project root directory of code projects you wish to use this plugin with. Be careful what you place in this file, as it will be sourced and ran as VimL code inside your Vim. The generated tags files will appear inside the same directory as your project configuration file.

Exclude directory option:

Inside the project configuration file, you have the option of excluding directories that you don't want to create tags from. Be careful what you place in this file, as it will be sourced and ran as VimL code inside your Vim. Here is an example of using the exclude directory option:
`let g:project_tags_exclude= ['mobile', 'generated_code']`
If you place that line inside your project configuration file, your tags files will not contain tag data from source files inside any subdirectories named "mobile" or "generated_code". The excluded directories will be treated as relative paths from the project file. This may be a useful feature if you frequently find yourself matching false positives when trying to do a code lookup based on tags and the false positives are all inside a specific directory. The exclude and include options can be helpful when used together on the same project.

Include directory option:

Inside the project configuration file, you have the option of including extra directories that you want to create tags from. Normally you don't need to use this as tags will be generated for code in your project, but you can use this to generate tags from files in a different location.  Be careful what you place in this file, as it will be sourced and ran as VimL code inside your Vim. Here is an example of using the exclude directory option:
`let g:project_tags_include= ['../../some library directory']`
If you place that line inside your project configuration file, your tags files will also contain tag data from source files inside that directory relative to your project configuration file. This is useful if you use a library from a different location. It is also useful when you are using the exclude option, but still want to generate tags from the rest of the project inside the directory being excluded.

Multiple file types in one tags file:

Even though the main point of this plugin is to separate file extensions into separate tags files, sometimes you actually want some in the same file. This might be the case if you are working with C code. You may want tags from your .c file and your .h files to exist in the same tags file. In that case there are advantages and disadvantages to keeping them separate or combining them. Combining them should make code completion via tag files more useful if you write your definition in a .h file first and your implemenation in a .c file later. However, it may make jump to work worse if you are trying to jump to the implementation in you .c files and it takes you to the defininition in a .h file. You also might be working with sloppy code where multiple languages exist in the same source file, so this may be another reason to combine multiple file extension types into a single tags file. Here is how you would add C support and combine .c and .h tags:

`call project_tags#add_language('ctags', ['c', 'h'])`

Notice you also have to specify the tags filename as the first parmeter. You can call it whatever you want, which brings me to the next option.

Custom tags file names:

You can create custom filenames for you tags files. Let's say you are adding python support, your tags files don't need to be called pytags:

`call project_tags#add_language('nopythontagshere', 'py')`

Notice how in that case you can keep 'py' as a string, it doesn't need to be in a list if you are just passing one file extension.
